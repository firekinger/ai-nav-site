            "question": "What is string art and how does your generator work?",
            "answer": "String art is a decorative technique where colored string is wound around pins or nails to form patterns or designs. The generator analyzes uploaded images and calculates the optimal string path, providing a detailed pattern and instructions."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do I need any special skills to use the String Art Generator?",
            "answer": "No special skills are needed; it's designed for beginners and experienced artists. Users upload an image, adjust settings, and download the pattern with guiding instructions."
        },
        {
            "question": "What types of images work best for string art?",
            "answer": "High-contrast images with clear subjects, such as portraits, silhouettes, simple landscapes, and logos, work best. The algorithm can handle complex images, but simpler compositions often produce striking results."
        },
        {
            "question": "How long does it take to generate a string art pattern?",
            "answer": "Pattern generation is nearly instant, typically within 30 seconds, though physical creation time depends on design complexity and size."
        },
        {
            "question": "What materials do I need to create the physical string art?",
            "answer": "Users need a board (circular or square), nails or pins, and string or embroidery thread. The pattern includes a complete materials list with exact measurements."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I customize the complexity and size of my string art pattern?",
            "answer": "Yes, users can adjust nail count (50 to 500+), string density, and overall complexity to match their skill level and preference."
