    "longDescription": "Composio is a developer-focused integration platform designed to simplify the connection of AI agents and large language models (LLMs) with external tools and services like GitHub, Slack, and Salesforce. Its mission is to streamline the process of turning LLM-driven prototypes into production-ready solutions, enabling developers to focus on functionality rather than complex API integrations. The platform offers SDKs, APIs, and prebuilt integrations to facilitate secure, authenticated access to over 250 tools, reducing development time significantly. By managing authentication protocols and optimizing tool calls, Composio empowers developers to build scalable, efficient AI-driven workflows. It supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, making it versatile for startups and enterprises alike. Composio also provides managed execution environments to ensure reliable and secure tool interactions.",
