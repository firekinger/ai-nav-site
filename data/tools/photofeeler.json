    "longDescription": "Photofeeler is an online platform that helps users enhance their profile pictures by providing anonymous feedback from real users and AI-driven analysis. Founded in 2013, it serves individuals aiming to improve their online presence on platforms like LinkedIn, Tinder, and social media by offering insights into how their photos are perceived. Users can test photos across three categories—business, social, and dating—each evaluated for specific traits like competence, likability, or attractiveness. The platform combines human votes with AI to ensure accurate, unbiased results, addressing the challenge of subjective feedback from friends or family. By allowing users to either earn credits through rating others’ photos or purchase credits, Photofeeler makes photo testing accessible while prioritizing user privacy and data security. Its mission is to empower users to select images that align with their professional, social, or romantic goals.",
