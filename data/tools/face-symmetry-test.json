    "faqs": [
        {
            "question": "How does the Face Symmetry Test work?",
            "answer": "Users upload a clear, frontal photo of their face, and the tool uses image analysis to detect key facial points and measure symmetry. It then calculates a score based on how evenly features like eyes, nose, and mouth align."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is the symmetry test accurate?",
            "answer": "The test provides a reliable estimate based on standard computer vision algorithms, but results can vary with photo quality, lighting, or angles. It's intended for entertainment and general insights rather than medical accuracy."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do I need to pay to use the site?",
            "answer": "No, the core symmetry test is completely free with no hidden fees or subscriptions required."
        },
        {
            "question": "What kind of photos work best?",
            "answer": "Use well-lit, straight-on photos with a neutral expression and no accessories like glasses for the most accurate results. Avoid side angles or poor lighting to ensure proper facial detection."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does the site store my photos?",
            "answer": "Photos are processed temporarily and not stored on the server after analysis, ensuring user privacy."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can symmetry scores indicate real beauty?",
            "answer": "Symmetry is one factor in perceived attractiveness, but beauty is subjective and influenced by many elements beyond symmetry. The scores are for fun and should not be taken as definitive judgments."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is this tool using AI?",
            "answer": "Yes, it employs AI-driven image analysis to detect and measure facial features accurately."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can I improve my symmetry score?",
            "answer": "The site offers tips like adjusting hairstyles or using makeup to balance asymmetries, though scores are inherent to facial structure."
