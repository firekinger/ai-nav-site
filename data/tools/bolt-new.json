    "longDescription": "Bolt.new is an innovative AI-powered web development platform designed to simplify the creation of full-stack web applications by allowing users to generate, edit, and deploy code directly in the browser. Developed by StackBlitz, it leverages WebContainers technology to provide a secure, in-browser development environment without the need for local setups. The platform supports a wide range of JavaScript frameworks and integrates with tools like Figma, Netlify, and Supabase, making it accessible to developers, designers, and non-coders alike. Its mission is to streamline prototyping, development, and deployment, enabling users to transform ideas into functional apps quickly. By combining natural language prompts with real-time code execution, Bolt.new empowers users to iterate rapidly and deploy production-ready applications with minimal effort. It’s particularly valuable for those seeking to prototype ideas or build scalable web solutions efficiently.",
