Founded by Phil Gooch in 2018, it aims to make knowledge more accessible for students, researchers, and professionals by reducing the time and effort needed to extract key information from research papers, reports, and book chapters. The platform addresses challenges like information overload and complex formatting by highlighting key findings, terms, and references in a structured format. It supports users by integrating with citation managers, offering export options, and providing tools for organizing and synthesizing research. Scholarcy is particularly beneficial for neurodivergent students, as its predictable flashcard format reduces distractions and enhances focus. Trusted by over 600,000 users worldwide, it streamlines academic workflows and supports critical analysis and literature reviews.",
