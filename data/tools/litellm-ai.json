    "longDescription": "LiteLLM is an open-source platform designed to streamline the integration and management of large language models (LLMs) by providing a unified API compatible with the OpenAI format, supporting over 100 providers like OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, and HuggingFace. Its mission is to simplify AI model access for developers and organizations, reducing complexity in handling multiple LLM APIs. The platform offers a Python SDK and a proxy server (LLM Gateway) to manage authentication, load balancing, and cost tracking across various LLM providers. It caters to developers and platform teams seeking efficient, scalable, and provider-agnostic LLM workflows. By abstracting provider-specific complexities, LiteLLM enables seamless model switching, cost optimization, and robust error handling, making it ideal for both experimentation and production-grade applications. Trusted by companies like Rocket Money and Adobe, it empowers users to focus on building AI-driven solutions without managing intricate API differences.",
