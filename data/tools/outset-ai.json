            "question": "What's Outset's pricing model?",
            "answer": "Outset uses an annual subscription model. Pricing is based on the number of user seats, projected usage, and selected features."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is my data safe with your platform?",
            "answer": "We use encryption protocols to safeguard data transmission, regularly monitor for any vulnerabilities, and implement industry-standard security practices."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does this compare to open-ended survey questions?",
            "answer": "Open-ended survey questions get notoriously low engagement (you often need to send it to 1000+ people just to get a few dozen good answers). Our AI-interview probes deeper and reacts in real-time to respondents’ answers, which evokes deeper, more actionable conversation."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is this as good as a human interview?",
            "answer": "AI-moderated research is a powerful tool in a research team’s toolkit to get in-depth data at a speed an order of magnitude faster than traditional methods. AI-moderated research is additive – uncovering insights you aren’t getting today – but not meant to replace human-led ethnographic researchers. In fact, many researchers use this to augment human-moderated methods to build a more nuanced and vibrant picture of their audience."

        {
            "question": "We need help recruiting participants. Can Outset help?",
