    "description": "Splitter.ai is an AI-driven platform that separates mixed audio tracks into individual stems like vocals, drums, bass, and instruments for music production and remixing.",
    "longDescription": "Splitter.ai is an online tool powered by artificial intelligence designed to split complete music tracks into their constituent parts, known as stems, such as isolating vocals from instruments. Its mission is to democratize access to advanced audio separation technology, making it available to musicians, producers, DJs, and hobbyists without needing specialized software or expertise. By using machine learning algorithms trained on vast datasets, the platform achieves high-fidelity separations that were previously difficult or expensive to obtain. This solves key problems in music creation, like enabling easy remixing, sampling, or karaoke track generation from any song. Users simply upload an audio file, select a model, and download the separated stems for further use in digital audio workstations.",
