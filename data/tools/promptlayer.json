    "description": "PromptLayer is a platform designed to help developers track, manage, and optimize their interactions with large language models like GPT.",
    "longDescription": "PromptLayer is a middleware tool that sits between applications and large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT, enabling developers to monitor and improve their AI prompt engineering. Its mission is to provide transparency and control over LLM usage, helping teams build more reliable and efficient AI-powered applications. By logging API calls, attaching metadata, and offering evaluation tools, it solves problems related to debugging prompts, managing costs, and scaling AI integrations. The platform serves software engineers, AI researchers, and product teams by turning opaque LLM interactions into actionable insights. Ultimately, PromptLayer aims to make prompt engineering a more scientific and collaborative process.",
