    "longDescription": "Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform designed to help developers search, understand, and manage large codebases efficiently. Founded in 2013 by Stanford graduates Quinn Slack and Beyang Liu, it addresses the challenges of navigating complex, multi-repository code environments across various programming languages. Its flagship products, Cody (an AI coding assistant) and Code Search, enable developers to write, fix, and explore code with context-aware insights. By integrating with popular code hosts like GitHub and GitLab, Sourcegraph streamlines workflows for enterprise teams and individual developers. The platform supports both cloud-based and self-hosted deployments, catering to organizations of all sizes. Its mission is to make coding accessible and efficient, empowering developers to focus on innovation rather than manual code navigation.",
