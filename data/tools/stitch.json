    "longDescription": "Stitch, developed by Google Labs, is an experimental AI-driven platform designed to streamline the app design and development process by transforming simple text prompts or image inputs into fully functional user interface (UI) designs and frontend code. Leveraging Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash models, it enables designers, developers, and non-technical users to create responsive mobile and web interfaces in minutes. The tool bridges the gap between design and development by offering seamless exports to Figma and clean HTML/CSS code, reducing manual effort and iteration time. Its mission is to make UI creation accessible, efficient, and collaborative for both professionals and beginners. By allowing conversational refinements and multiple design variants, Stitch empowers users to explore creative ideas and rapidly prototype applications. It’s particularly useful for startups, solo developers, and teams aiming to accelerate the transition from concept to functional prototype.",
