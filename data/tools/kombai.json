    "description": "Kombai is an AI-powered tool that converts Figma designs into high-quality, production-ready front-end code to streamline web development.",
    "longDescription": "Kombai is an innovative AI platform that automates the conversion of Figma prototypes into clean, semantic code, primarily focusing on React for web applications. Its mission is to eliminate the tedious manual coding process from designs, enabling faster collaboration between designers and developers while reducing errors in handoffs. By using advanced machine learning, Kombai interprets design layers, layouts, and interactions to generate logical code structures that match the original intent. This solves key problems in web development workflows, such as time-consuming translations from design tools to code, making it ideal for teams building responsive websites. Users can integrate it directly with Figma, select elements, and receive instant code outputs that are customizable and ready for refinement.",
