    "longDescription": "Cobot is a revolutionary to-do app that leverages AI agents, known as Cobots, to automatically complete tasks by integrating with users' existing applications. Its mission is to transform AI into a collaborative teammate, enabling autonomous productivity and exponential efficiency gains for individuals and teams. By simply adding a task, users can offload the execution to Cobot, which handles it using connected tools like email, calendar, and project management software. This solves common productivity challenges such as manual repetition and context-switching, allowing focus on creative and strategic work. Currently in beta, Cobot is accessible on iOS and web, with features for building and scheduling custom workflows.",
