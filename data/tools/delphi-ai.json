    "longDescription": "Delphi is a platform that leverages artificial intelligence to create digital clones of experts, coaches, and creators, enabling them to scale their expertise through personalized, one-on-one interactions with their audience. By uploading content such as text, audio, or video, users can train a digital mind that mirrors their knowledge, tone, and style, making it available 24/7 across various platforms like SMS, WhatsApp, and websites. The platform aims to empower creators to engage deeply with their followers, qualify leads, and monetize their expertise without sacrificing time or authenticity. Delphi addresses the challenge of limited human scalability by offering a solution that preserves an individual’s unique perspective while providing actionable insights and analytics to refine content strategies. Founded by Dara Ladjevardian, the company has raised significant funding to enhance its web-based toolkit, focusing on creators with substantial followings, such as influencers and thought leaders. It also emphasizes privacy and copyright protection, ensuring creators retain control over their digital clones.",
