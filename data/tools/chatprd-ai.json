    "longDescription": "ChatPRD is an innovative AI tool designed to streamline the process of creating Product Requirements Documents, which are essential for product development teams. Founded by product management experts, its mission is to save time and reduce the tedium associated with drafting PRDs by leveraging advanced language models like those from OpenAI. Users interact with the platform via a chat interface, where they input ideas, requirements, or prompts, and the AI generates structured sections such as objectives, user stories, and technical specs. This serves product managers, engineers, and stakeholders by providing a collaborative, efficient way to document product visions and solve the problem of inconsistent or incomplete PRDs. Ultimately, ChatPRD democratizes access to high-quality documentation tools, making it easier for teams to align on product goals without extensive manual writing.",
