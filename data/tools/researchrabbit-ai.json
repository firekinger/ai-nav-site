    "description": "ResearchRabbit is an AI-powered tool for discovering and organizing scholarly literature through visualization and personalized recommendations.",
    "longDescription": "ResearchRabbit is an AI-driven platform designed to streamline academic research by helping researchers discover, organize, and visualize scholarly literature. Founded in 2021 by a small team in Seattle, it aims to simplify the often complex and time-consuming process of literature review. The tool allows users to start with a 'seed' paper and explore related publications through citation networks, authorship connections, and AI-generated recommendations. By offering intuitive visualization maps and a column-based interface, it supports unstructured research workflows, making it easier to navigate vast academic databases. ResearchRabbit’s mission is to empower researchers by providing free, efficient tools that enhance literature discovery without selling user data or research back to them. It integrates with tools like Zotero and leverages databases like OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar to provide comprehensive results.",
