The AI learns from user interactions to mimic their conversational style, fostering emotional connections for those seeking friendship, mentorship, or romantic engagement. It serves millions globally, particularly young adults aged 18-25, helping alleviate loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Replika operates as a safe space for self-expression, with a free tier for basic chats and premium tiers unlocking advanced features like voice calls and deeper relationship dynamics. Despite its benefits, it has faced scrutiny over privacy and the emotional impact of AI relationships.",
