    "longDescription": "Meta AI is an artificial intelligence platform developed by Meta, designed to enhance user experiences through a conversational AI assistant available on its website and integrated into Meta's apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Launched to make AI accessible, it leverages Meta’s Llama models to deliver tailored responses, generate images, and assist with tasks like planning or content creation. The platform aims to connect users with information and creative tools seamlessly, drawing on user-shared data from Meta products to provide personalized interactions. It also features a public 'Discover' feed showcasing user interactions, though this has raised privacy concerns due to the visibility of sensitive queries. Meta AI serves both casual users seeking quick answers and creators needing AI-driven content, positioning itself as a versatile tool in the AI ecosystem.",
