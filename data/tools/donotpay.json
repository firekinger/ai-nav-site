    "longDescription": "DoNotPay is an American company founded in 2015 by Joshua Browder, offering an AI-driven 'robot lawyer' service designed to empower consumers by simplifying legal and bureaucratic tasks. The platform uses artificial intelligence to assist users in contesting parking tickets, canceling subscriptions, and seeking refunds, aiming to level the playing field against large corporations. It provides automated tools to generate legal documents, negotiate bills, and handle consumer rights issues, making legal services more accessible. While not a law firm, DoNotPay offers affordable solutions for common legal challenges in the U.S. and U.K. The service has faced criticism for misleading claims about its AI capabilities, resulting in a 2024 FTC fine, but it remains a popular tool for consumer advocacy.",
