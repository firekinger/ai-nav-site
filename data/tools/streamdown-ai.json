    "longDescription": "Streamdown is a standalone library that facilitates the streaming and rendering of Markdown content in AI applications, addressing the challenges of handling incomplete or tokenized inputs. Its mission is to provide developers with a secure, easy-to-use tool that ensures perfectly formatted outputs without manual intervention, making it ideal for real-time AI interfaces. By incorporating plugins for advanced syntax like GFM, math expressions, and diagrams, it enhances the functionality of AI-driven content display. Streamdown powers the AI Elements Response component but can be installed independently for broader use. It solves problems related to prompt injection and unterminated Markdown blocks, promoting safer and more efficient development.",
