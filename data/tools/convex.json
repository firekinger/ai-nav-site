    "longDescription": "Convex is an open-source, reactive database and backend-as-a-service platform designed to simplify full-stack application development for web and mobile developers. Its mission is to empower developers to build fast, reliable, and dynamic apps without managing complex backend infrastructure or database administration. By integrating TypeScript-based queries, real-time updates, and serverless functions, Convex eliminates the need for developers to handle state management, WebSockets, or cache invalidation. It serves both human developers and AI-driven coding platforms, offering a seamless developer experience with strong consistency and scalability. The platform supports frameworks like React and Next.js, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment. Convex��s team, with experience from companies like Dropbox, aims to redefine how software is built on the internet.",
