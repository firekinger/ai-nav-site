    "description": "Hyper3D is an AI-powered platform that generates production-ready 3D models and assets from text or images for various creative industries.",
    "longDescription": "Hyper3D, developed by Deemos Technology, is an innovative AI-driven platform designed to simplify and accelerate the creation of high-quality 3D models for industries like gaming, animation, virtual reality, and product design. Its flagship tools, Rodin and ChatAvatar, leverage proprietary diffusion models to transform text prompts or 2D images into detailed, production-ready 3D assets with physically based rendering (PBR) textures. The platform caters to a wide audience, from individual creators and educators to large enterprises, offering an intuitive interface and API integration for seamless workflow incorporation. By reducing the complexity and time required for 3D modeling, Hyper3D empowers users to focus on creativity and innovation. The platform also supports multiple export formats, ensuring compatibility with industry-standard tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Maya. Its recent Series A funding round highlights its growing influence and commitment to advancing AI-driven 3D model generation globally.",
