    "longDescription": "LlamaIndex is an open-source data orchestration framework designed to connect large language models (LLMs) with diverse data sources, enabling developers to create context-augmented AI applications. It simplifies the process of ingesting, indexing, and querying structured and unstructured data, such as PDFs, APIs, and databases, to enhance LLM performance. The platform supports both Python and TypeScript, catering to beginners with high-level APIs and advanced users with customizable low-level modules. LlamaIndex's mission is to empower developers to build scalable, production-ready AI agents that leverage private or domain-specific data for tasks like research, data extraction, and automation. By offering tools like LlamaParse and LlamaCloud, it streamlines complex document processing and knowledge management for enterprises. Trusted by startups and large organizations, LlamaIndex is a leading solution for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.",
