    "longDescription": "Scite is an innovative AI-driven research tool designed to help academics, researchers, and students discover, evaluate, and understand scientific literature more effectively. Founded in 2018 by Josh Nicholson and Yuri Lazebnik, it leverages a proprietary machine learning model to analyze over 1.3 billion citation statements, providing context on whether citations support, contrast, or merely mention a referenced work. By offering 'Smart Citations,' Scite addresses the limitations of traditional citation indices, which often lack contextual insights, thus aiding researchers in assessing the credibility and impact of studies. The platform serves a global community of over two million users, partnering with major publishers like Wiley and Sage to ensure comprehensive access to scholarly content. Scite also includes an AI Assistant to streamline literature searches and provide evidence-based answers, making it a vital tool for combating information overload and enhancing research reproducibility.",
